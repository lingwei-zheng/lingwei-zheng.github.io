<!-- 1. Polish and fix any issues -->

<!-- 1. Enjoy your website! -->

I am a researcher in geoinformatics and spatial data science pursuing a PhD in the Department of Geography and Resource Management ([GRM](https://www.grm.cuhk.edu.hk/en/)) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Mei-Po Kwan](http://meipokwan.org/) and [Prof. Zihan Kan](https://www.zihankan.com/). I also serve as a research fellow at the Computational Social Science Laboratory ([CSSL\@CUHK](https://cssl.socsc.cuhk.edu.hk/)) and Institute of Space and Earth Information Science ([ISEIS](http://www.iseis.cuhk.edu.hk/en/)).

I am interested in human mobility, travel behavior, and the relationship between urban environments and well-being. My research focuses on:

1.  How urban characteristics influence mobility and public well-being.
2.  The application of spatial data science and machine learning in urban studies.
3.  Advancing methods for spatial analysis and causal inference in human-environment interactions.
