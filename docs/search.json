    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nGreenspaces are crucial for enhancing mental and physical health. Recent research has shifted from static methods of assessing exposure to greenspaces, based on fixed locations, to dynamic approaches that account for individual mobility. These dynamic evaluations utilize advanced technologies like GPS tracking and remote sensing to provide more precise exposure estimates. However, little work has been conducted to compare dynamic and static exposure assessments and the effect of individual mobility on these evaluations. This study delves into how greenspaces around homes and workplaces, along with mobility patterns, affect dynamic greenspace exposure in Hong Kong. Data was collected from 787 participants in four communities in Hong Kong using GPS, portable sensors, and surveys. Using multiple statistical tests, our study revealed significant variations in participants‚Äô daily mobility patterns across socio-demographic and temporal factors. Further, using linear mixed-effects models, we identified complex and statistically significant interactions between participants‚Äô static greenspace exposure and their mobility patterns. Our findings suggest that individual mobility patterns significantly modify the relationship between static and dynamic greenspace exposure and play a critical role in explaining socio-demographic and temporal context differences in the relationship between static and dynamic greenspace exposure."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered urban transportation patterns, leading to significant changes in people‚Äôs daily travel behavior. Scholars have attributed this shift to individuals‚Äô perceived pandemic risk, suggesting that higher perceived risk discourages daily travel. However, existing research has produced mixed results regarding the relationship between perceived risk and mobility. This study aims to clarify these conflicting findings by proposing that travel flexibility moderates the relationship between perceived COVID-19 risk and daily mobility. Based on online survey data from Hong Kong and employing a logistic regression model, our findings show that the impact of perceived risk on daily mobility varies according to individuals‚Äô levels of travel flexibility. Specifically, individuals with low travel flexibility experience a significant reduction in mobility due to perceived risk, whereas those with high travel flexibility are relatively unaffected. This research underscores the complex interplay between perceived risk, travel flexibility, and daily mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the critical role that travel flexibility plays in understanding the relationship between perceived risk and mobility."
